Create a HIN first from the given data 


3 datasets are used :: us_import[1,2,3]
Steps :

- Create network with transition probabilities  
    according to co-occurrence and meta paths   
- Do Random Walks   
- Create 'Sentences' out of random walks    
  
  
The code for these for these    
1. Random_Walk_v1.py    
2. NetworkSetup.py
